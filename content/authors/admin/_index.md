**About me**

I am a [CNRS](https://www.cnrs.fr/) researcher at [LIPhy](https://liphy.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/) in Grenoble, France. I use molecular simulations to study fluids at interfaces and soft matter systems.

**Open source and open data**

I share all the codes developed as part of my research as open source, see for instance:

- my [Github](https://github.com/simongravelle/) repository containing molecular simulation scripts and data,
- [NMRforMD](https://nmrformd.readthedocs.io), a Python script for calculating hydrogen NMR relaxation rates from molecular dynamics simulations,

In parallel to my open-source projects, I have been involved in the development of [MAICoS](https://maicos-devel.gitlab.io/maicos/index.html), a Python toolkit for analyzing confined molecular simulations.

**Outreach**

In parallel to my research activities, I am developing several outreach projects, including:
- the [LAMMPS tutorials](https://lammpstutorials.github.io) webpage and its associated [repositories](https://github.com/lammpstutorials),
- [MDCourse](https://github.com/mdcourse/mdcourse.github.io): Learn Molecular Simulations with Python,
- the [GROMACS tutorials](https://gromacstutorials.github.io) page,
- a [gallery of animations](https://www.youtube.com/@SimonGravelle) and [molecular art](https://simongravelle.github.io/gallery/).
